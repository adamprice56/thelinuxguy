In a world of security risks and bad passwords, people need to step up their game at some point. Enforcing password policies, forcing complex passwords and prompting people to keep changing their passwords will never work. 

__People use the same password everywhere.__

It's as simple as that, Everyone would rather type CorgisRule123 every day to log into their PC than LnjJgnuR<58i-af3rk#yrGQ]nn<rnk55, It's just how humans are. We don't like sitting there typing one letter at a time for 30 seconds to then have to wonder whether it's a lower case L or a captital I whilst raising a finger at the password prompt and then looking over at Jane, happily typing away after admitting her love of Corgi's to her PC.

Something's got to change. People will **always** find ways to make their life easier... and generally that will mean peoples passwords wil slowly become defined by this: 

~~~~
A Dictionary word or name of a person/pet then a number/set of numbers, Year of significant event (Birthday, Wedding etc.)
~~~~

So, for example... Hunter2, Spain1965, Cherry2016, Amazing77 or even Password123. Any of these look familiar? If so, you're in the right place!

For the more "Security concious" people out there, It doesn't take much to turn these passwords into more complex, but easy to remember versions. Maybe Hun73r2!, Sp41n1965#, (Ch3rry2o16) or Am4z1nG77$. Okay, some are easier than others, but you get the idea!
