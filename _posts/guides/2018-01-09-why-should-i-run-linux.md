I'm sure you've heard a lot about Linux and how it has a reputation for being for "Hackers" or "Techy people"... But these days, Linux is just as easy to use as as any other system on your PC or Mac. 

One other thing that seems to scare people away is the idea of installing it yourself and all of the big warning messages that people throw around saying things like "**You'll lose all your data!**" or "**This will void your warranty!**". 

_Yeah. That sounds pretty scary, right?_

The good news is, You're not on your own. There's a lot of people that would like to try Linux but don't know where to start. Well, My answer is to start where you feel comfortable. Whether that's trying it on an old PC, renting a server or just looking at videos online.

One of the greatest things about Linux (in my opinion) is the fact it runs on just about anything and you may even use Linux daily without even knowing it. Yep, Your snazzy new Samsung, HTC, Huawei or Google phone runs Android, which is based on Linux!
